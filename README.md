# Nothern Trust Hackathon Team 7

We have created a dashboard which fetches data of ohlc and plots chart of that data.
We have created a mobile application for better usability and performance.

## Deployment

To deploy this project on your local devices

```bash
  cd fronted
  npm i
  npm start

  cd backend
  npm i
  node app
```

This will start frontend on port 3000 and backend on port 5000

for mobile app

```bash
  flutter hub get
  flutter run
```

You need to change localhost to your pc ip address to get result
